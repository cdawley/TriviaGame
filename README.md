## Flags of the World Trivia Game

This is a trivia game featuring the flags of **_over 200_ world countries!**

The game uses Wikipedia's REST API to present images of national flags. Possible answers, along with the correct answer, are presented to the player in each "round" of the game.

In each round, the player is given 10 seconds to answer each question. Within this 10 second time span, players can change their choice (if no choice is made during this time, nothing will be counted for/against the player.)

At the end of the 10 seconds, the player is prevented from making a choice or changing whatever choice they've made. The "Check Answer" buttons next is changed to "Next Question", upon clicking this button (regardless of the state of the game), the answer is checked if one was selected.
